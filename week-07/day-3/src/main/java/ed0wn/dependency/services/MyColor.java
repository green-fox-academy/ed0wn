// # Playing around with colors


// There is one interface given:

public interface MyColor {
  public void printColor();
}

// Any kind of color class (for i.e. RedColor) can implement this interface overriding `printColor();` sout-ing for i.e. `"It is red in color..."`.

// - Implement the interface multiple times for different colors
// - Annotate one of them with `@Service` and autowire the interface in the application and use the `printColor` method
// - Move the annotation to another implementation
// - Change the implementations to use the `Printer` service with autowiring (instead of sout-ing)
